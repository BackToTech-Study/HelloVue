## How to view output on local machine without NodeJS
* You must have an entry point in the application (in our case index.html)
* index.html must load VueJS via a CDN (content delivery network) or hosted localy (downside is we don't get any new features and updates)
* To bypas CORS regulations when loading local files via import in pure JS we need a local server (I recomend Live Server plugin for VS Code)
* To view output just start the index.html page in Live server.
