# HelloVue - first steps in Vue
* Vuew is A framework 
* follow tutorial - https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-1

## Types
* [ ] Vue using Options
* [ ] Vue using Composition
* [ ] Vue in HTML
* [ ] Vue in SCF (Single-File Components)
* [ ] Wich one is most used !!!

## Demo concepts
* [ ] Declarative Rendering 
* [ ] Event Listeners 
* [ ] Form Bindings 
* [ ] Conditional Rendering 
* [ ] List Rendering 
* [ ] Computed Property 
* [ ] Lifecycle and Template Refs 
* [ ] Watchers 
* [ ] Components 
* [ ] Slots 
* [x] Emits can be used to call a callback function defined in the parent
```
    <script>
    function handleRemove(todo) {
        console.log(`removed: ${todo.id} - ${todo.text}`);
    }
    </script>
    ....
    <List :todosParam = todoList @remove = "handleRemove" />
```

```
    removeTodo(todo) {
      this.todos.splice(this.todos.indexOf(todo), 1)
      this.$emit('remove', todo)
    }
```


* [x] Attribute Bindings (passing props to a component). Implemented using `v-bind:` or short `:`
```
    <List :todos = "[ { id: 1, text: 'Learn HTML' },  { id: 2, text: 'Learn JavaScript' }, { id: 3, text: 'Learn Vue' }]" />
```

* [x] Props Component parameters are received with `props`
```
  props: {
    todos: Array
  },
```

* [x] Props are read only. You can save them in local variable
```
  props: {
    todosParam: Array
  },
  data() {
    return {
      newTodo: '',
      todos: this.todosParam
    }
  },
```

* [x] `v-model` used as 2 way binding
```
    <input v-model="newTodo">
```

## How to view output on local machine without NodeJS
* You must have an entry point in the application (in our case `index.html`)
* `index.html` must load VueJS via a CDN (content delivery network) or hosted localy (downside is we don't get any new features and updates)
* To bypas CORS regulations when loading local files via import in pure JS we need a local server (I recomend Live Server plugin for VS Code)
* To view output just start the `index.html` page in Live server.
* the `index.html` file will load the content of `app.js`
```
        <script type="module">1
            import app from './app.js';
            const { createApp } = Vue;

            createApp(app).mount('#app');
        </script>
```
* the `app.js` imports and uses the `From.js`
```
    import Form from "./Form.js"
    ...
    <div><Form></Form></div>
```
* In this case the `Form.js` file was created by hand (hard coded). The browser does not know about the .vue extension.

## HelloVue Generated by NPM INIT

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### Volar 
* Is a VSCode plugin that offers vue language support
* Volar uses [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue), an alternative distribution of Vue optimized for progressive enhancement.
* Volar also supports Static Site Generation using [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/what-is-vitepress.html)
    * VitePress is currently in alpha status. It is already suitable for out-of-the-box documentation use, but the config and theming API may still change between minor releases.

### [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* Vite is a lightweight and fast build tool with first-class Vue SFC support. It is created by Evan You, who is also the author of Vue!
* Vue CLI is the official webpack-based toolchain for Vue. It is now in maintenance mode and we recommend starting new projects with Vite unless you rely on specific webpack-only features. Vite will provide superior developer experience in most cases.
* in this example the vite configuration information is stored in the `vite.config.js` file

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

###3 Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e # or `npm run test:e2e:ci` for headless testing
```

#### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### How is everytinhg connected
* The `index.html` file loads the `/src/main.js` file.
* The `main.js` will load the `App.vue` 
```
    import App from './App.vue'
```
* The `App.vue` loads other required components
